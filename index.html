  <h3>about</h2>
  <p>
    Hi, my name is Quezia, and I am a bachelor's student in Information Systems at IFBA. I aspire to become a full-stack software developer, and to achieve this, I am currently seeking internships or opportunities to apply my knowledge and gain experience. In addition to programming, I have a strong interest in drawing, high fantasy books, and learning to play musical instruments.
